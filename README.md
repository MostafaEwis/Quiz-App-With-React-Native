# Quiz-App-With-React-Native
Hello, Zatek team
this is the app you asked for 
using the navigation component you start from the Main screen then to the Quest screen then to Review screen then back to Main
the colors is in the colors file
the categories of the questions is saved in an items pairing it with its value starting from 9 to 32 for specific categories and 0 or Any category
the shuffel method used to randomize answers is from : https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/

bugs :
1- the answers shuffels every time the component renders
2- the chossen answers is not obvious
3- choosing an answer doesn't add it to choosen answer


note : didn't use redux because i didn't have enough time to learn it ,
I could fix the bugs but I really have no time because of Exams ,
Not everything in the app is perfect as I has just learned React and React Native while having exams
lastly : I'm sorry if I make perfect but I was stressed and had no time
